Preparation: Close the shutoff valves on the pump or remove the tubing from the solvent bottles to avoid leaks. Ensure you wear safety goggles and gloves to protect yourself from hazardous solvents and the uncovered needle [3], [1].

Maintenance Mode: Start the maintenance mode in the user interface and select the &quot;Change needle/seat&quot; function. Alternatively, use the Agilent Lab Advisor software to access this function under the &quot;Tools&quot; section [1].

Access the Needle Seat: Open the front door of the autosampler. Disconnect the seat capillary from the injection valve [1].

Remove the Needle Seat: Carefully lift out the needle seat from its holder using a flat-head screwdriver [3], [1].

Inspect and Replace: Check the needle seat for visible damage or blockages. If necessary, replace it with a new needle seat (e.g., part number G1367-87012). Press the new needle seat firmly into position [1].

Reassembly: Reconnect the seat capillary to the injection valve and close the front door [1].

Exit Maintenance Mode: Exit the &quot;Change needle/seat&quot; function and the maintenance mode in the user interface or Lab Advisor software [1].

Testing: Perform a pressure test to ensure the leak has been resolved. If the leak persists, additional troubleshooting may be required, such as backflushing the needle seat or replacing the needle assembly [2], [1].


Always follow safety procedures and consult the service manual for detailed guidance.

Causes:

Incorrect Host Name in License File: The license file may contain a server line with a hostname that does not match the license server or cannot be resolved by DNS. For example, the error message might indicate, &quot;The license file does not contain a server line that matches the license server&quot; [5].

Licensing Support Service Not Running: The Agilent OpenLab Licensing Support service may be stopped or not running properly, which prevents the license from being added [5].

Exceeding License File Entry Limits: License files containing too many components (e.g., exceeding the limit of 78 entries) can cause the failure. This issue is common with files that include both OpenLab Agilent licenses and third-party driver licenses [2], [4], [3].

Third-Party Licenses or Unnecessary Items: Including third-party driver licenses or unnecessary features in the license file can lead to errors [2], [3].


Solutions:

Correct Host Name: Verify the hostname in the license file and ensure it matches the license server. If the hostname is incorrect, return the license to the customer license pool and generate a new license with the correct details [5].

Restart Licensing Support Service: Manually start the Agilent OpenLab Licensing Support service before attempting to add the license. If the service is stopped, it must be restarted [5].

Split the License File: If the license file contains too many entries, split it into two parts or remove unnecessary items. For example, removing third-party driver licenses or reducing the number of features to meet the entry limit (78) can resolve the issue [2], [4], [3].

Use a Slimmed-Down License File: Create a modified license file with fewer items and test it to ensure it works. Support may provide a new license file tailored to the system&#x27;s requirements [2], [3].


By following these steps, most &quot;failed to add license&quot; errors can be resolved effectively.

Causes:

Incorrect Host Name in the License File:

The license file may contain a server line with a host name that does not match the license server or cannot be resolved by DNS [5].


Agilent OpenLab Licensing Support Service Not Running:

The licensing support service may be stopped, preventing the addition of licenses [5].


Exceeding License File Entry Limits:

OpenLab CDS can only import up to 78 license features in a single license file. Files with too many entries (e.g., 84 or 100 items) exceed this limit and cause errors [4], [4], [2].


Inclusion of Unnecessary or Third-Party Licenses:

License files containing third-party driver licenses or unnecessary items may lead to failure [4], [4].



Solutions:

Correct the Host Name:

Verify the host name in the license file. If incorrect, return the license to the customer license pool in SubscribeNet and generate a new license with the correct host name [5].


Start the Licensing Support Service:

Manually start the Agilent OpenLab Licensing Support service in Windows before attempting to add the license [5].


Split the License File:

If the license file contains too many entries, split it into two parts and add them separately [5], [4], [2].


Remove Unnecessary Entries:

Remove third-party driver licenses or other unwanted features from the license file. Use a slimmed-down license file with fewer items [4], [4], [2].


Restart License Services:

Restart the license services before uploading the new license if an error occurred during a previous attempt [4].



By addressing these common causes, you can resolve the &quot;failed to add license&quot; errors effectively.

Contamination in the Detector:

Cause: Contamination can lead to baseline drift and noise.
Fix: Perform thermal cleaning (bakeout) of the detector. Set the detector temperature to 375°C and hold for several hours. Ensure inert carrier gas flow through the column if attached, or cap the detector if the column is not installed [3].


Poor Quality or Contaminated Carrier Gas:

Cause: Contaminated gas can saturate traps and cause noise.
Fix: Verify the purity of carrier and detector gases. If a new gas tank was recently installed, test the older tank (if available) to check for improvement. Replace or regenerate traps if necessary [1].


Environmental Conditions:

Cause: Temperature or humidity fluctuations can affect the system.
Fix: Ensure stable environmental conditions, including constant temperature and humidity [2].


Loose Connections or Improper Reassembly:

Cause: Loose connections in the detector or signal path can generate noise.
Fix: Inspect the detector for loose connections and verify proper reassembly after maintenance [1].


Column Contamination:

Cause: A contaminated column can result in drifting baselines.
Fix: Rinse the column properly or replace it if necessary [2].

Causes and Resolutions:

Air Bubble in the Flow Cell:

Flush the detector with 100% organic solvent at 1 mL/min for 15–30 minutes.
Turn the detector back on while the flow is still running [4].


CPU Battery Voltage Low (&lt;2.8V):

Replace the CPU battery if the voltage is below 2.8V.
Access the PDA console, navigate to Troubleshoot &gt; Service Mode, enter the password (1147), and reset the calibration constants to the correct values [2].


Calibration Constants Lost:

If the CPU is replaced or the battery voltage is low, the calibration constants may default to an incorrect range (e.g., 800 nm instead of 500 nm). Reset the calibration constants in the PDA console [2].


Detector Initialization Issues:

Check the PDA shutter (filter wheel) for fogginess or cracks and replace it if necessary.
Verify the low voltage power supply outputs (5V, 12V, and 24V) and replace the LVPS if needed [4].


Lamp or Energy Issues:

Replace the deuterium lamp if it is faulty.
Allow the detector to equilibrate for 30 minutes after turning on the lamp before starting acquisition [4].


Erbium Calibration:

Perform erbium calibration and save the values. Then, run the wavelength verification test [4].

Steps to Investigate Root Cause #2:

Confirm Error Details:

ChemStation:
Open the Logbook by navigating to View &gt; Logbook &gt; Current Logbook.
Review the log entries for error messages or unusual events.


MassHunter:
Open the Logbook Viewer by navigating to Tools &gt; Logbook Viewer.
Look for characteristic error messages such as &quot;Leak detected,&quot; &quot;Ignition failed,&quot; or &quot;Missing vessel&quot; [4].




Identify Characteristic Error Messages:

Common error messages include:
Leak Error: Indicates a leak in the system. Check for loose connections, especially near the column entrance.
Ignition Failed: Indicates that the DAD light did not turn on. Allow the system to cool for 5 minutes before attempting to turn it on again.
Missing Vessel: Indicates that the autosampler could not find a vial at the specified location. Reset the autosampler by right-clicking its icon and selecting Reset Autosampler.
Gas Supply Issues: For errors related to dry gas, nebulizer pressure, or sheath gas timeout, ensure the nitrogen gas supply pressure is sufficient (minimum 0.65 MPa). If the pressure is insufficient, contact the generator manufacturer [4].




Correct the Problem:

If the error is understood, take corrective action:
Leak Error: Locate the leak point, tighten connections, and reinstall components as necessary.
Ignition Failed: Ensure the system has cooled sufficiently before retrying.
Gas Supply Issues: Verify the nitrogen generator&#x27;s supply pressure and resolve any issues with the gas supply system [4].




Address Temperature Control Issues:

If the error involves temperature control (e.g., condensation sensor error):
Check the waste liquid line for sagging or blockages.
Ensure proper drainage and correct the position of the waste liquid tip if necessary [4].




Log and Analyze Data:

Turn on logging features to capture detailed system behavior:
Use Problem Steps Recorder to document the steps leading to the error.
Enable logging by typing SLOG in the command line and pressing Enter.
For sequence-related issues, type FULLSEQDEBUG=1 in the command line and press Enter [2].




Cross-Check Logs and Events:

Cross-check the logs and events with the date and time of the problem to pinpoint the exact cause.
If necessary, send problematic log entries to the Field Support Group (FSG) for clarification [4], [4].



Additional Notes:

Ensure all software patches and updates are installed, including SDA, ECM, ECM xT, or other relevant systems [4].
If the issue persists or the root cause remains unclear, escalate the problem to the Field Support Engineer (FSE) for further analysis [4].

Steps to Investigate Root Cause #2:

Confirm Error Details:

ChemStation:
Open the Logbook by navigating to View &gt; Logbook &gt; Current Logbook.
Review the log entries for error messages or unusual events.


MassHunter:
Open the Logbook Viewer by navigating to Tools &gt; Logbook Viewer.
Look for characteristic error messages such as &quot;Leak detected,&quot; &quot;Ignition failed,&quot; or &quot;Missing vessel&quot; [4].




Identify Characteristic Error Messages:

Common error messages include:
Leak Error: Indicates a leak in the system. Check for loose connections, especially near the column entrance.
Ignition Failed: Indicates that the DAD light did not turn on. Allow the system to cool for 5 minutes before attempting to turn it on again.
Missing Vessel: Indicates that the autosampler could not find a vial at the specified location. Reset the autosampler by right-clicking its icon and selecting Reset Autosampler.
Gas Supply Issues: For errors related to dry gas, nebulizer pressure, or sheath gas timeout, ensure the nitrogen gas supply pressure is sufficient (minimum 0.65 MPa). If the pressure is insufficient, contact the generator manufacturer [4].




Correct the Problem:

If the error is understood, take corrective action:
Leak Error: Locate the leak point, tighten connections, and reinstall components as necessary.
Ignition Failed: Ensure the system has cooled sufficiently before retrying.
Gas Supply Issues: Verify the nitrogen generator&#x27;s supply pressure and resolve any issues with the gas supply system [4].




Address Temperature Control Issues:

If the error involves temperature control (e.g., condensation sensor error):
Check the waste liquid line for sagging or blockages.
Ensure proper drainage and correct the position of the waste liquid tip if necessary [4].




Log and Analyze Data:

Turn on logging features to capture detailed system behavior:
Use Problem Steps Recorder to document the steps leading to the error.
Enable logging by typing SLOG in the command line and pressing Enter.
For sequence-related issues, type FULLSEQDEBUG=1 in the command line and press Enter [2].




Cross-Check Logs and Events:

Cross-check the logs and events with the date and time of the problem to pinpoint the exact cause.
If necessary, send problematic log entries to the Field Support Group (FSG) for clarification [4], [4].



Additional Notes:

Ensure all software patches and updates are installed, including SDA, ECM, ECM xT, or other relevant systems [4].
If the issue persists or the root cause remains unclear, escalate the problem to the Field Support Engineer (FSE) for further analysis [4].

Incorrect Host Name in License File: The license file may contain a server line with a hostname that cannot be resolved by DNS. For example, the error message might indicate that the specified host is unknown. This issue can be resolved by generating a new license file with the correct hostname [5].

Licensing Support Service Not Running: The Agilent OpenLab Licensing Support service may be stopped, causing the license addition to fail. Restarting the service manually before adding the license can resolve this issue [5].

License File Exceeding Feature Limits: OpenLab CDS can only import a limited number of license features in a single file (e.g., 78 features). If the license file contains too many entries, such as third-party drivers or unnecessary items, it will fail. Splitting the license file into smaller parts or removing unnecessary features can fix this problem [4], [4], [2].

Third-Party Driver Licenses: Including third-party driver licenses in the file may cause compatibility issues. Removing these entries or using a slimmed-down license file can resolve the error [4].


Steps to Fix:

Verify Hostname: Ensure the hostname in the license file matches the license server and regenerate the license if needed [5].
Restart Licensing Service: Manually start the Agilent OpenLab Licensing Support service before retrying [5].
Modify License File: Split the license file into smaller parts or remove unnecessary entries to meet the feature limit. Test the modified license file to confirm functionality [4], [4], [2].
Remove Third-Party Licenses: Eliminate third-party driver licenses and other excessive items from the file [4].

By following these steps, the &quot;failed to add license&quot; error can typically be resolved.

Top 5 Causes and Fixes:

Contamination in the Detector:

Cause: Contamination in the TCD detector can lead to noise and drift.
Fix: Perform a thermal cleaning (bakeout) of the detector. Set the detector temperature to 375°C and hold for several hours. Ensure inert carrier gas flow through the column if attached, or cap the detector if the column is removed [4].


Gas Quality Issues:

Cause: Contaminated carrier or detector gases can saturate traps and cause noise.
Fix: Verify the purity of gases. If a new gas tank was recently installed, test the older tank (if available) to check for improvement. Replace or regenerate traps if necessary [1].


Column Contamination:

Cause: A contaminated column can contribute to baseline drift.
Fix: Rinse the column properly or replace it if necessary [2].


Environmental Conditions:

Cause: Fluctuations in ambient air pressure or air currents (e.g., from fans or air conditioners) can interfere with gas exiting the detector.
Fix: Shield the detector exit or switch off the air current source. Install a TCD outlet restrictor if needed [1].


Detector Maintenance Issues:

Cause: Improper reassembly or loose connections in the detector signal path can generate noise.
Fix: Inspect the detector for contamination and verify proper reassembly after recent maintenance. Replace parts as needed [1].



Relevant Documents:

IKB Articles:
&quot;GC TCD Typical Problems &amp; Troubleshooting Tips&quot; [4].
&quot;ICS baseline drift is too high&quot; [2].
&quot;7890 Micro ECD _Baseline goes high and Output is high&quot; [4].

Incorrect Host Name in License File: The license file may contain a server line that does not match the license server or includes a host name that cannot be resolved by DNS. This issue can be resolved by returning the license to the customer license pool in Subscribenet and generating a new license with the correct host name [5].

Licensing Support Service Not Running: The Agilent OpenLab Licensing Support service may be stopped or not running in Windows services. To fix this, manually start the Licensing Support service before attempting to add the license [5].

Exceeding License File Entry Limits: License files may contain too many components or entries, exceeding the limit allowed by OpenLab CDS (e.g., 78 entries). This can be resolved by splitting the license file into two parts or removing unnecessary items from the license file [2], [4], [3].

Third-Party Drivers or Unnecessary Features: Including third-party driver licenses or other unnecessary features in the license file can cause errors. Removing these items and using a slimmed-down license file can resolve the issue [2], [4].


Steps to Fix:

Verify the host name in the license file and regenerate the license if necessary [5].
Ensure the Licensing Support service is running before adding the license [5].
Split the license file into smaller parts or remove unnecessary entries to meet the entry limit [2], [4], [3].
Test the modified license file to confirm it works [3].

Were the reagents spun down to ensure no air bubbles were present [4], [4]?


Environmental Conditions:

Was the Magnis operated under the recommended environmental conditions (15-25°C and 30%-70% humidity) [4]?


Consumable Placement:

Were the consumables placed on the deck following the touchscreen instructions [4]?
Did the user visually check the seal of the Beads &amp; Buffer Plate for warping, bulging, or abnormalities before starting the run [4]?


Input DNA/RNA Quality:

Was the input DNA/RNA sample checked for correct volume, concentration, and quality as outlined in the SureSelect Magnis User Guides [4]?
If enzymatic shearing was performed, was the input DNA volume set to 14 µL, and was the shearing time adjusted appropriately [4]?


Probe Preparation:

Were the probes added accurately to the probe input strip using an appropriate pipette to ensure correct volumes (5 µL or 2 µL) [4]?


Pictures and Logs:

Did the user take pictures of the deck setup, including the Beads &amp; Buffer Plate, and provide logs from the Magnis run [4], [2]?


Tip Box Placement:

Were the tip boxes placed correctly within their platforms, and did the user perform an auto-teach to verify alignment before the run [2]?


Reagent Lot and Storage:

Were the reagents stored under the recommended conditions, and was the reagent lot number checked for consistency across runs [4]?



By asking these questions, you can identify potential errors in sample preparation or setup that might explain the lack of final libraries.

The context mentions that scripts and procedures can vary significantly between versions (e.g., differences between versions 1.2 and 1.3) [2]. It’s likely that version 1.5 requires updated tools or scripts.2. Backup Utility Changes: For UV Workstation Plus version 1.4 and later, Task Scheduler is no longer supported, meaning you need to reconfigure the location and schedule of backups using the Backup Utility instead of relying on older methods [1].3. Correct Procedure Documentation: Obtain documentation specific to UV Workstation Plus 1.5 for its backup process, as earlier documents (e.g., G5194-90004 for v1.3) may not apply [2]. Agilent&#x27;s Subscribenet platform might have updated manuals or tools tailored for v1.5.4. Script Path Verification: If you’re using a custom script, verify its compatibility with new folder structures or libraries introduced in v1.5 (similar issues were noted when transitioning from v1.2) [3].5. Incremental vs Full Backups: Confirm whether incremental backups are still supported in version 1.5, as this feature was explicitly mentioned for v1.3 but may differ in newer versions [2].6. Administrative Rights &amp; Disaster Recovery Testing: Ensure administrative rights are granted during setup and test disaster recovery plans to confirm backups are sufficient for restoring your system [1].If these steps don’t resolve the issue, I recommend reaching out to Agilent support directly or consulting their knowledge base articles specific to UV Workstation Plus version 1.5 for further guidance on implementing backups successfully under this new environment.Let me know if you need help locating additional resources!

However, based on the details about UV Workstation Plus 1.3, here are steps to address the backup issues and implement backups for UV Workstation Plus 1.5:1. Verify Compatibility of Backup Utility: UV Workstation Plus 1.3 introduced a Backup Utility (P/N G5194-90004) that simplified the backup process by combining database and content management backups without requiring manual service stops. Check if this utility is compatible with version 1.5 or if there is an updated version specifically for 1.5 [2], [4].2. Task Scheduler Changes: Starting from version 1.4, Task Scheduler is no longer supported for backups. Ensure that the backup configuration for version 1.5 does not rely on Task Scheduler and uses the updated Backup Utility [3].3. Backup Location: Confirm that the backup location is set to a local path, as network drives are not supported for backups in later versions (1.4 and above). Ensure the backup folders are correctly created in the specified local directory [3].4. Incremental Backup Setup: Incremental backups were introduced in UV Workstation Plus 1.3. If version 1.5 supports incremental backups, ensure that both full and incremental backups are configured correctly, as incremental backups require a full backup for restoration [2].5. Check Script Dependencies: If scripts are still being used, verify that all required files are located in the correct directories. For example, errors in UV Workstation Plus 1.2 occurred due to missing files like `dr-base-library.ps1` or incorrect script paths [3].6. Administrative Rights: Ensure that the user performing the backup has administrative rights on the workstation, as this is mandatory for both full and incremental backups [3].7. Review Documentation: Refer to the installation and administration guide for UV Workstation Plus 1.3 (e.g., document G5194-90004) as a reference to understand the backup process. If similar procedures apply to version 1.5, adapt them accordingly [2], [4].8.

Based on this, here are steps to address the backup issues for UV Workstation Plus 1.5:1. Verify Compatibility of Backup Scripts: The backup scripts that worked for UV Workstation Plus 1.3 may not be compatible with version 1.5. Ensure that the scripts are updated or check if Agilent has released new tools for version 1.5. For UV Workstation Plus 1.3, the Backup Utility was introduced to simplify the process [2], [2].2. Use the Backup Utility: UV Workstation Plus 1.3 utilized a Backup Utility (P/N G5194-90004) that combined database and content management backups without requiring manual service stops. Check if this utility is still supported or updated for version 1.5 [2].3. Incremental Backup Setup: Incremental backups were introduced in UV Workstation Plus 1.3. If version 1.5 supports incremental backups, ensure that both full and incremental backups are configured correctly, as incremental backups require a full backup for restoration [2].4. Check Script Paths and Dependencies: If scripts are still being used, verify that all required files are located in the correct directories. For example, errors in UV Workstation Plus 1.3 occurred due to missing or misplaced files or incorrect script paths [2].5. Review Documentation: Refer to the installation and administration guide for UV Workstation Plus 1.3 (e.g., document G5194-90004) to understand the backup process. If similar procedures apply to version 1.5, adapt them accordingly [2].6.

                <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-500"><div class="truncate-text" title="Guide to Detaching or Removing an Invoice in iLab
1. Explain the Context
Detaching an invoice in iLab involves removing it from its associated billing event. This action is typically necessary in situations such as:

Correcting errors in invoice details.
Reassigning the invoice to a different billing event.
Deleting unwanted invoices from a billing event.

Once detached, the invoice is marked with a red-lettered &quot;Detached&quot; status and moved to a separate section for detached invoices. This ensures the invoice can be tracked and reassigned later if needed [4], [4].

2. Step-by-Step Instructions
Follow these steps to detach an invoice:

Locate the Invoice:

Navigate to the Billing Tab of the core facility.
Find the billing event with a status of either &quot;Billing Initialized&quot; or &quot;Draft&quot; that contains the invoice you wish to detach.


Access the Invoice:

Click on the relevant billing event to display a list of invoices.
Use the magnifying glass icon to open the specific invoice you wish to detach.


Detach the Invoice:

At the top of the invoice details page, click the Detach Invoice icon.
A &quot;Detach Invoice&quot; window will appear. Optionally, enter a note in the provided field to document the reason for detachment.
Click Detach Invoice to finalize the process. The invoice will now display a red-lettered &quot;Detached&quot; status [4], [4].


Locate Detached Invoices:

Detached invoices are automatically moved to the View Detached Invoices section under the Billing Tab.
Use the Invoices filter panel to search for detached invoices for easy aggregation [4], [4].




3. Address Common Issues or Roadblocks

Permissions Restriction: Not all institutions allow invoice detachment. If you cannot see the &quot;Detach Invoice&quot; option, check with your institution&#x27;s administration to verify whether detachment is permitted [4].
Missing Invoice: Ensure the invoice is part of a billing event with the correct status (&quot;Billing Initialized&quot; or &quot;Draft&quot;). Invoices from finalized billing events cannot be detached [4].

1. Explain the Context
Detaching an invoice in iLab involves removing it from its associated billing event. This action is typically necessary in situations such as:

Correcting errors in invoice details.
Reassigning the invoice to a different billing event.
Deleting unwanted invoices from a billing event.

Once detached, the invoice is marked with a red-lettered &quot;Detached&quot; status and moved to a separate section for detached invoices. This ensures the invoice can be tracked and reassigned later if needed [4], [4].

2. Step-by-Step Instructions
Follow these steps to detach an invoice:

Locate the Invoice:

Navigate to the Billing Tab of the core facility.
Find the billing event with a status of either &quot;Billing Initialized&quot; or &quot;Draft&quot; that contains the invoice you wish to detach.


Access the Invoice:

Click on the relevant billing event to display a list of invoices.
Use the magnifying glass icon to open the specific invoice you wish to detach.


Detach the Invoice:

At the top of the invoice details page, click the Detach Invoice icon.
A &quot;Detach Invoice&quot; window will appear. Optionally, enter a note in the provided field to document the reason for detachment.
Click Detach Invoice to finalize the process. The invoice will now display a red-lettered &quot;Detached&quot; status [4], [4].


Locate Detached Invoices:

Detached invoices are automatically moved to the View Detached Invoices section under the Billing Tab.
Use the Invoices filter panel to search for detached invoices for easy aggregation [4], [4].




3. Address Common Issues or Roadblocks

Permissions Restriction: Not all institutions allow invoice detachment. If you cannot see the &quot;Detach Invoice&quot; option, check with your institution&#x27;s administration to verify whether detachment is permitted [4].
Missing Invoice: Ensure the invoice is part of a billing event with the correct status (&quot;Billing Initialized&quot; or &quot;Draft&quot;). Invoices from finalized billing events cannot be detached [4].
System Errors: If the detachment icon does not work or the system displays an error, clear your browser cache, reload the page, or contact iLab support for assistance.

Based on the provided context, here are the top five potential causes and their respective fixes:### Causes and Fixes:1. Contaminated Carrier Gas     - Cause: Contaminants in carrier gas can saturate traps, leading to high noise levels. This issue is particularly common with nitrogen carrier gas [1].     - Fix: Verify the purity of carrier gases. If a new tank was recently installed, try using an older tank (if available) to check for improvements. Replace or regenerate traps if contamination persists [1].2. Detector Contamination     - Cause: Gradual accumulation of contaminants in the detector can lead to unacceptable noise levels [1], [5].     - Fix: Perform a bakeout procedure for the TCD to remove contaminants [1]. Inspect the detector thoroughly and replace parts as needed [5].3. Loose Connections or Signal Path Issues     - Cause: Loose connections in the detector or its signal path may generate noise [1].     - Fix: Verify proper reassembly after recent maintenance and ensure all connections are secure [1].4. Environmental Factors (Air Currents)     - Cause: Air currents from fans or air conditioners blowing across the GC may interfere with gas exiting the detector, causing fluctuations [1].     - Fix: Switch off air current sources or shield the detector exit area appropriately. Install a TCD outlet restrictor if necessary (part number: G1532-60070) [1].5. Column Contamination     - Cause: A contaminated column can result in baseline drift due to improper equilibration or eluent contamination [4].     - Fix: Rinse or replace the column as needed, ensure proper system equilibration, and use fresh eluent while checking filters for contamination [4].### Relevant Documents:- From IKB: &quot;Frequent GC Issues&quot; discusses troubleshooting strategies for high background noise/spikes and other related problems ([2], [3]). - From User Manuals: The Agilent 7890 Series Troubleshooting guide provides detailed steps like bakeout procedures for detectors and inlet systems ([1], [5]).Let me know if you need further clarification!

Review Site Preparation- Action: Verify that the site meets all preparation requirements, including:  - Adequate laboratory space with proper clearances around the instrument.  - Correct electrical outlets and power supply.  - Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) within the specified range [4].- Follow-up: Ensure the instrument is placed in its permanent location and confirm all consumables and supplies are available [4].---### 2. Inspect Instrument Setup- Action: Check the physical setup of the Magnis instrument, including:  - Alignment of the Z gantry and pipette module.  - Placement of consumables such as tip boxes, reagent plates, and Beads &amp; Buffer plates.  - Proper latching of plates into the spring-loaded mechanism [1], [3].- Follow-up: Perform an auto-teach to verify alignment. If auto-teach fails, manually adjust teach points and run post-repair tests [1].---### 3. Check Instrument Components- Action: Inspect critical components for damage or misalignment:  - Pipette module barrels for deformation.  - Magnets within the HSM for proper positioning [2].- Follow-up: Replace any damaged components and test their functionality.---### 4. Analyze Logs and Run Data- Action: Retrieve and review log files from previous runs to identify hidden errors or anomalies.- Follow-up: Check the consumables lot numbers and compare them to known issues or recalls [2].---### 5. Perform Test Runs- Action: Conduct a test run using validated samples and reagents to confirm the instrument is functioning correctly.- Follow-up: Monitor the run closely for any deviations or errors, and verify the final libraries are prepared successfully [1].---### 6. Provide Training- Action: If user errors are suspected, provide training on proper consumable placement, reagent preparation, and run setup.- Follow-up: Ensure the user understands how to operate the Magnis instrument according to the manual [3].---### 7.

Put the autosampler in mainpass mode.4. Set the 2-position/6-port MCT valve to forward-flush mode (valve position 1-2).5. Bypass the degasser by connecting all four solvent lines directly to the solvent selection valve to avoid damage during passivation [1], [2].### Passivation Solution Preparation:1. Dilute concentrated (65%) nitric acid with an equal volume of HPLC-grade water to create a solution containing 32.5% nitric acid [1], [2].### Cleaning Procedure:1. Place inline filters for all channels into a clean beaker containing HPLC-grade isopropanol.2. Set pump flow rates as follows:   - Purge at 5 mL/min for 5 minutes (25% per channel).   - Run isopropanol through each channel at 0.5 mL/min for 10 minutes.3. Repeat steps using HPLC-grade water instead of isopropanol.### Passivation Process:1. Use the prepared Passivation Solution and pump it through each channel at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min for at least 4 hours but no more than 8 hours [2].2. Flush thoroughly with fresh HPLC-grade water until pH &gt;4.5 is achieved in effluent from PEEK tubing outlet [3], [4].### Final Steps:1. Reconnect degasser channels and solvent selection valve after confirming neutralized pH (&gt;4) of LC effluent.2. Replace restriction capillary and union with your analytical column.3. Replace frits for outlet filters if necessary [3], [4].Caution: Ensure thorough flushing after acidic solvents are used, as residual acidity can impact negative ionization performance during subsequent analyses [1].

Problemas de conexión al servidor: Si no puedes conectarte al servidor OpenLab, verifica las configuraciones del dominio en Windows y asegúrate de que la contraseña esté correctamente guardada. Reinicia los servicios compartidos de OpenLab y revisa los registros en el directorio `C:\ProgramData\Agilent\LogFiles` para identificar posibles errores [3].2. Problemas de inicio de sesión: Si los usuarios no pueden iniciar sesión, confirma que el problema está relacionado con la configuración de red entre el servidor y los clientes/AICs. Es recomendable consolidar esfuerzos en un único ticket si el problema afecta a múltiples ubicaciones [4].3. Licencias: Para instalaciones nuevas, se otorga una licencia inicial por 60 días. Antes de que expire, instala una licencia válida desde la pestaña &quot;Add License&quot; en el panel de control (`Control Panel &gt;&gt; Administration &gt;&gt; Licenses`). También puedes verificar las licencias disponibles y activas mediante esta ruta [2].4. Configuración TCP/IP LAN: Asegúrate de que las configuraciones IP sean correctas para conectar instrumentos a través del panel de control OpenLAB. Esto incluye ajustes como direcciones IP estáticas o deshabilitar DHCP cuando sea necesario [1].Si necesitas más detalles sobre algún procedimiento específico o enfrentaste un error particular, proporciónalo para poder ayudarte mejor.

Modify Cleanup Frequency: Configure settings to run cleanup jobs more frequently. This ensures that stale tickets or deleted data are processed faster [1].3. Restart Services: After modifying these settings, restart the `alfrescoTomcat` service to apply changes effectively [1].4. Use Configuration Utility: Access the server and use a configuration utility to make necessary adjustments to settings related to cleanup jobs [1].5. Empty Trash Manually (if needed): If files are moved to Alfresco&#x27;s trash can during deletion, ensure you manually empty it within Alfresco for permanent removal of stale tickets or data [2].

This error prevents startup or tuning of the instrument and typically arises due to a hardware malfunction in either the QP Tank PCA or QP Controller PCA.### Explanation of Error:The error occurs when the +48V power supply is not detected while connected to the QP Tank PCA. However, when disconnected, voltage readings show that +48V is present. This suggests that there is no issue with the power supply itself but rather with one of the boards responsible for managing this voltage.### Root Cause:- Faulty QP Driver Board: Either the QP Tank PCA or QP Controller PCA could be defective.- Ribbon Cable Damage: The main ribbon cable connecting the controller board to other components may have a burned-out red strip.- Feedback Error: A feedback mechanism failure might prevent proper voltage detection.### Steps to Fix:1. Check Ribbon Cable: Inspect the main ribbon cable from the main board to controller for any visible damage (e.g., burned-out sections).2. Test Boards Separately:   - Disconnect and test both QP Tank PCA and QP Controller PCA using another working ICP-MS instrument (e.g., another 7850 model).   - Identify which board fails during testing.3. Replace Faulty Component:   - If testing confirms that either QP Tank PCA or Controller PCA is faulty, order replacements for these parts.4. Verify Voltage Readings:   - Ensure +48V is consistently supplied after replacing faulty components by checking through maintenance screen settings.5. Reassemble and Test Instrument:   - Reconnect all cables and boards properly.   - Perform startup and tuning procedures to confirm functionality.### Spare Parts Required:Based on troubleshooting steps outlined above, you may need to order:1. QP Tank PCA – Replacement part if this board is identified as faulty.2. QP Controller PCA – Replacement part if this board fails during testing.3. Main Ribbon Cable – Order if physical inspection reveals damage such as burns or breaks in connectivity.By systematically following these steps, you should be able to resolve this issue even without prior engineering experience [1].
