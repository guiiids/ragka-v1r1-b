# Active Context - Redis Implementation

## Current Status
Redis caching has been successfully implemented for the RAGKA v1r1 system to improve performance and reduce API costs. The implementation includes graceful fallback mechanisms and can be easily disabled if needed.

## Implementation Complete
- **Redis Service**: Created a robust Redis service with connection management, error handling, and serialization/deserialization
- **Cache Wrapper**: Implemented a wrapper around the RAG assistant that adds caching functionality
- **Docker Integration**: Updated Docker configuration to include Redis server
- **API Endpoints**: Added endpoints for cache statistics and management
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the Redis implementation

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Caching Layer**: 
   - Embeddings: 7-day TTL
   - Search Results: 24-hour TTL
   - RAG Responses: 12-hour TTL

2. **Intelligent Caching**:
   - Follow-up questions are not cached (conversation-dependent)
   - Cache keys use MD5 hashing of inputs for efficiency
   - Automatic serialization/deserialization of complex objects

3. **Monitoring & Management**:
   - Cache statistics API endpoint
   - Cache clearing API endpoint with type-specific options
   - Health checks and connection management

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - System falls back to non-cached behavior if Redis is unavailable
   - No single point of failure introduced

## Testing & Validation
- Unit tests created for Redis service and cache wrapper
- Test script for demonstrating and validating caching behavior
- Performance testing shows significant latency improvements for repeated queries

## Risk Mitigation Implemented
- **Graceful Degradation**: All Redis operations have fallbacks to original behavior
- **Feature Flags**: Redis can be disabled via environment variables
- **Monitoring**: Cache statistics available via API
- **Rollback Plan**: Simple environment variable changes to disable Redis

## Next Steps
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Collect metrics on cache hit/miss rates and latency improvements
2. **Cache Optimization**: Fine-tune TTL values based on usage patterns
3. **Advanced Features**: Consider implementing cache warming and more sophisticated invalidation strategies
4. **Distributed Caching**: Evaluate Redis Cluster for high-availability scenarios
